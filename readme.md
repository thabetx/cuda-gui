# CUDA ImGui

CUDA ImGui is a UI for comparing and visualizing imageprocesing-CUDA kernels.

It's based on the excellent [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). The code is a in single file (`main.cu`). To compile and run, install [Nvidia's CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) then open `cuda-imgui.sln` with Visual Studio.
